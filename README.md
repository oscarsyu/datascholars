# Data Scholars
As a Data 8 Tutor in Fall 2019, I led the Data Scholars Foundations course (CS 198-801) at UC Berkeley, teaching 24 first-generation and 
underrepresented students.  I built this curriculum from scratch to expose students to industry standards, visualization, data ethics, and guest speakers.  
This repository contains the teaching material I created and used.
